I had learned basic of Html and Css in  2019 after Covid hit . So I had a notion how can I make the basic e-commerce website.
At that time I had make some of the simple websites.
So I used that prior knowlege and the things I learned in class plus some reseach and make this website using the basic boiler plate of almost all e-commerce websites. 
Seed : Watching some of the projects of tech youtubers like Code with Harry and code with Babbar , I tried to replicate how they made design. Out of the some options from the instruction , I
found a website that is related with recycling plastic form ocean and using it to make products. The webiste  is https://pryme-cleantech.com/ .
Design Rationalate : used dark and light blue as primary and secondary colours as it indicates ocean and used a blue recylce svg so that it matches the theme .

Also used cto (call to action button ) as it is a part of all e-commerce websites for ordering.
The name of website is although random , Aerostyle is particularly a shoe complany but it matches
the type of names in instructions so it was selected by me.
